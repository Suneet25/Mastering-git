Learning git right now.

git log - to check previous commit
git checkout <branchId>-It will help to change head if code breaks on prod , its really helpful.
git checkout -b <branchName>-It will create a new branch and it will take you to the new branch.
git branch <new-branch-name> <the branch from you want to take code>-It will inherit from that branch you have provide in source.
